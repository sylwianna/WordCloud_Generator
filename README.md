## Inspiriration
:bulb: I found out about the concept of a word cloud during my studies and the project I was working on back then and I liked the idea. Later on, I thought "Why not get more creative and print the result on the mug as a gift or create a descriptive LinkedIn background and also have fun learning some Python?".
