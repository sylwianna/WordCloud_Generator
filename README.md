## General Info
Word cloud, also known as wordle, word collage or tag cloud, is a visual representation of words. It helps to quickly present and highlight the most common and most important words or answers in case of a survey or feedback.
Word Cloud Generator is a script in Python which allows you to create a visualisation of word data in a form of a cloud using list of words or simply a plain text. By adjusting script parameters and list of words you can manipulate and shape the resulting image; change resolution, font or backgroud colours and frequency or weight of presented words etc.

### How to use

## Inspiration
:bulb: I found out about the concept of a word cloud during my studies and the project I was working on back then and I liked the idea. Later on, I thought "Why not get more creative and print the result on the mug as a gift or create a descriptive LinkedIn background and also have fun learning some Python?".
